# Issue Tracking with Redmine

I was looking around for a solid issue tracking system, written using Ruby on Rails.  There are some good comparisons on wikipedia.  Redmine seems like a good choice; all the standard functionality, that you would expect from a issue tracking system, is available.  For instance:-

* Raising Bugs/Defects
* Request Features
* Adding Patches
* Roadmaps
* Forums
* Wiki
* Code Repository

The code repository can use the source control apps, Git and Subversion.

All in all, a pretty solid choice.
